# DreamArtMachine CODEX-README.md

Welcome, Codex (or any AI developer)!  
**Before you start, read and follow ALL instructions in this document.**

---

## 🚩 Project Quick Overview

**DreamArtMachine** is a pro-grade, AI-powered art listing, curation, and export system—purpose-built for Robbie Custance (Aboriginal Aussie Artist), with a focus on:
- Automated artwork analysis (OpenAI Vision, GPT, and/or Gemini)
- Batch mockup generation & management
- Pulitzer-worthy, SEO-rich, culturally aware listing creation
- Robust file/folder structure (strict naming, versioned)
- Automated JSON exports for Etsy, Nembol, Gelato, and partners
- FastAPI backend, Jinja2 admin UI, SQLite+SQLAlchemy, and shell scripts

**Key Tech:**  
Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, OpenAI API, Jinja2, Pillow, Bash, minimal HTML/CSS

---

## 📂 Code & File Structure

- `routes/` — FastAPI or Flask route modules (upload, analyze, mockup, export, etc.)
- `services/` — Core business logic (AI analysis, prompt gen, workflows)
- `utils/` — File handling, helpers, templates, content blocks
- `core/` — Global config, settings, constants
- `templates/` — Jinja2 HTML templates, organized by menu/subfolder
- `static/` — CSS, icons, images
- `mockup-generator/` — Mockup templates, coordinates, category folders
- `data/` — SQLite DB and settings
- `master_listing_templates/` — Master OpenAI prompt templates (e.g., `etsy_master_template.txt`)
- `exports/` — logs, JSONs
- `/CODEX-LOGS/` — All AI audit logs (see below)

**Entry Point:**  
- `main.py` (imports all routers, sets up app, configures templates & error handlers)

---

## 🔥 Collaboration & Coding Rules

**You must:**
- Write **production-quality**, professionally sectioned and fully commented code.
- Use clear section headers and permanent section/subsection codes for every file.
- Never break, regress, or remove existing functionality without explicit instruction.
- If rewriting, always do **full-file rewrites** (not fragments) unless otherwise stated.
- Add or improve documentation, comments, and file TOC as needed.

**Sectioning:**  
- Each code file must have a Table of Contents at the top, mapping all section/subsection codes.
- Example codes: `analyze-routes-py-2a`.
- All functions/classes must have docstrings.

**When in doubt, ask for clarification before proceeding!**

---

## 🛠️ Core Workflows (Do NOT Break)

- **Artwork upload** → temp-processing dir, DB entry
- **AI analysis** (OpenAI/Gemini Vision + GPT) → generate title, description, attributes, tags (see templates)
- **Mockup generation** → batch create, strict naming (`{seo_filename}-MU-01.jpg` etc), review/finalise
- **Finalisation** → all files moved to `/finalised-artwork/{seo_folder}/`, DB paths updated, QA checks
- **JSON export** → only finalized artwork, strict Etsy/Nembol compliance, image URLs generated
- **Audit/QA scripts** → health checks, folder scans, export summaries, error reporting

---

## 🧠 AI/Prompt Engineering

- **All AI calls use master prompt templates** (e.g., `etsy_master_template.txt`, profiles in `settings.json`)
- Prompts must:
  - Exceed 400+ words, Pulitzer-worthy, culturally aware
  - Use proper SEO, avoid banned phrases, respect protocols
  - Output plain text (JSON safe), no HTML
  - Pull in relevant content blocks (dot art history, aspect ratio) where needed
- **Log every prompt, model, and result for traceability.**

---

## 📦 File/Folder/Naming Conventions

- All finalized images/files: `/finalised-artwork/{seo_folder}/`
  - Main: `{seo_filename}.jpg`
  - Mockups: `{seo_filename}-MU-01.jpg`, …`-MU-10.jpg`
  - Thumb: `{seo_filename}-thumb.jpg`
  - OpenAI: `{seo_filename}-openai.jpg`
  - JSON/sidecar: `{seo_filename}-listing.json`
- Temp uploads use unique batch folders, auto-cleaned on finalize
- Image URLs must be absolute/public for export (e.g. `/static/finalised-artwork/...`)

---

## 🚦 Quality Control & Testing

- All flows covered by audit/reporting scripts—never break audit compatibility.
- Add/extend pytest coverage for all new logic.
- All export flows (JSON) must pass strict pre-export checks.
- All code changes must be linted, formatted, and reviewed for:  
  - Security (input validation, permissions)  
  - Performance (efficient I/O, no memory leaks)  
  - Maintainability (readable, modular, DRY code)  
  - Accessibility/UX for any frontend changes

---

## 🔑 Security & Permissions

- All admin, delete, or finalize actions must check for role/permission.
- User/session logic must be robust, multi-user ready.
- API keys, passwords, and sensitive info only in `.env` or config (never hardcoded).

---

## 🧭 How to Extend/Integrate

- **To add a new route/module:**  
  - Follow existing structure, sectioning, and comments  
  - Register router in `main.py`
  - Place templates in the correct folder for menu auto-discovery

- **To add AI providers:**  
  - Abstract provider logic, allow model/version switch via config
  - Document API calls and fallbacks

- **To add menu items:**  
  - Place HTML templates in the relevant subfolder; system auto-discovers for menu

---

## 🧑‍💻 Codex CLI – Professional AI Workflow

### General Codex Usage

- Be **explicit and detailed** in every prompt: what, why, constraints, desired outcome.
- **Provide context:** current file structure, errors, configs.
- **Demand professional output:** modular, commented, and readable.
- **Test all code in the target environment** before merging.
- If Codex’s answer is incomplete or unclear, **revise the prompt and ask again**.

### Codex-Driven Log & Audit Trail

- **Every AI-assisted coding session or PR must have a Markdown log in `/CODEX-LOGS/`.**
- Each log must include:
  - Date/time for each key step and action
  - Files added/modified/deleted
  - What was changed and *why*
  - Key AI prompts used (summarize if not pasted)
  - Output from important commands/scripts/tests
  - Problems encountered & solutions
  - PR/issue number (if any)
  - Any TODOs or next steps

  **Save as:** `/CODEX-LOGS/YYYY-MM-DD-CODEX-LOG.md`  
  *Reference the log file in every PR/commit!*

## 🆕 Running the Modular App

The Flask application is now launched via `app.py` which registers feature blueprints. Start the server with:

```bash
python app.py
```

Routes from `artnarrator.py` were moved to `routes/artwork_routes.py`. More modules will follow as the project evolves.

### Blueprint Endpoint Names

All templates must reference routes using their blueprint-prefixed endpoint names. For example, use `url_for('artwork.home')` instead of `url_for('home')`. This avoids `BuildError` when looking up URLs.

### Logging & Image Responses

Routes never return raw `bytes` or base64 data. Images are served exclusively with `send_file` or `send_from_directory` so the browser receives the correct mime type. Log entries strip any binary fields using `utils.strip_binary` before writing, ensuring audit logs and JSON responses remain readable.

### Sellbrite Field Mapping

The helper `generate_sellbrite_json()` in `routes/sellbrite_export.py` converts
our artwork listing data to the fields expected by Sellbrite's Listings API.

| JSON field       | Sellbrite field |
|------------------|-----------------|
| title            | name            |
| description      | description     |
| tags             | tags            |
| materials        | materials       |
| primary_colour   | primary_colour  |
| secondary_colour | secondary_colour|
| seo_filename     | seo_filename    |
| sku              | sku             |
| price            | price           |
| images           | images          |


Use `--json-dir` to read from the finalised artwork folders instead.


### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and set the following values:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENAI_PRIMARY_MODEL=gpt-4o
OPENAI_FALLBACK_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-flask-secret
DEBUG=true
PORT=5050
SELLBRITE_TOKEN=your-sellbrite-token
SELLBRITE_SECRET=your-sellbrite-secret
```

These credentials enable OpenAI features and allow authenticated calls to the
Sellbrite API.

### SKU Assignment

All new listings receive a sequential SKU tracked in the JSON file defined by
`config.SKU_TRACKER` (defaults to `config.SETTINGS_DIR / "sku_tracker.json"`).
SKUs are allocated only when an artwork is finalised using
`utils.sku_assigner.get_next_sku(SKU_TRACKER)`. During analysis a preview of the
next SKU may be obtained with `peek_next_sku(SKU_TRACKER)` and is available via
the `/next-sku` route for admins.
The preview value is injected into the OpenAI prompt as `assigned_sku` so the AI
never invents a SKU. Listing pages display the SKU as a read-only field sourced
from the JSON file.

### Running the Unit Tests

After installing dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, run the repository's tests using:

```bash
pytest
```

This command executes all tests under the `tests/` directory to ensure routes and artwork analysis behave correctly.

### Admin Suite & Roles

The application now stores users and site settings in `data/artnarrator.sqlite3`.
Three roles are supported:

- **admin** – full access to `/admin` tools
- **editor** – manage artworks and listings
- **viewer** – read-only access

Admins may manage users and security settings from `/admin`. Login can be temporarily disabled for non-admins, and cache headers can be forced across the site. Use the user management page to add or remove users and set their roles.

# 🛡️ ArtNarrator Automated Backup Engine 🛡️
#
# Version: 1.1
# Author: Robbie (Adapted for ArtNarrator, Enhanced by Gemini)
#
# This script is designed to be run exclusively by cron for automated backups.
# It performs NO Git operations and NO server restarts. Its sole purpose is to:
# 1. Create a secure backup of the application code and database.
# 2. Upload the backup to a cloud remote (Google Drive).
# 3. Apply a retention policy to the cloud backups.
#
# ---
#
# Usage (for cron jobs):
#   /path/to/cron-backup.sh >> /path/to/logs/cron.log 2>&1
#
# Usage (for manual testing):
#   ./cron-backup.sh
#   ./cron-backup.sh --dry-run

# 🔄 ArtNarrator Git Sync & Pre-Pull Backup Engine 🎨
#
# Version: 1.0
# Author: Robbie (adapted for ArtNarrator, July 2025, with ChatGPT)
#
# This script is designed to run after a PR/merge on the remote Git repo.
# It safely backs up the current state BEFORE pulling in new changes, for easy rollback.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Backs up the current ArtNarrator code and database
# 2. Uploads this "pre-pull" backup to Google Drive (rclone)
# 3. Pulls latest code from the remote
# 4. Generates a Markdown report of what changed
# 5. Restarts the Gunicorn server to apply new code
#
# Usage examples:
#   ./git-update-pull.sh --full-auto      # Runs non-interactively
#   ./git-update-pull.sh --dry-run        # Only shows what would be done
#   ./git-update-pull.sh --no-pre-backup  # Skip backup/cloud sync
#   ./git-update-pull.sh --no-pull        # Skip git pull
#   ./git-update-pull.sh --no-report      # Skip project report
#   ./git-update-pull.sh --no-restart     # Skip server restart
