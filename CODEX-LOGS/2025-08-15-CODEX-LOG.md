# Codex Log - Pytest configuration fix

**Date:** 2025-08-15

## Actions
- Consolidated pytest configuration into root `conftest.py` with cleanup fixture.
- Added session-level cleanup removing test folders and JSON entries.
- Created this log file under `/CODEX-LOGS/`.

## QA & Testing
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `pytest` (fails: OPENAI_API_KEY not set)

## Problems & Solutions
- Tests require `OPENAI_API_KEY`; environment lacks credentials, so tests could not run to completion.

## PR
- Pending
