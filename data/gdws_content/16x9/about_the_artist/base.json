    "content": "G\u2019day, I\u2019m Robin Custance\u2014Aboriginal Aussie artist, part-time Kangaroo whisperer, and lifelong storyteller through colour, line, and imagination. My journey began on Kaurna Country here in Adelaide, and my roots reach back to the Naracoorte region (Boandik Country). \n\nEvery artwork I create\u2014whether it\u2019s dot painting, digital design, or contemporary Aussie landscape\u2014carries a deep respect for Country, community, and the vibrant stories handed down through generations.\n\nNo matter the style or subject, my intention as an artist is always to tell stories and share genuine emotion. Whether I\u2019m working with ancient dot techniques, digital brushes, or bold, modern colours, I pour heart and meaning into every piece.\n\nMy art is a way to give back and keep culture strong\u2014blending the timeless with the modern, and weaving together my heritage with today\u2019s creative spirit. When you bring my art into your home, you\u2019re welcoming a piece of Australian story and soul, crafted with passion and a fair bit of character.",
